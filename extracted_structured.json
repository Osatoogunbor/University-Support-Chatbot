You might like to suggest going for a walk together, or invite your friend round for a drink or meal. - Choose somewhere quiet without interruptions: You might choose somewhere familiar, such as your bedroom—anywhere you feel able to talk freely. Communal kitchens and living spaces can be cosy, but remember that people wandering in and out can make it difficult for your friend to feel comfortable enough to open up.  - **When to talk** - One-to-one: If you have shared concerns with others, remember it can be intimidating if everyone approaches your friend at once. A private conversation with just the two of you can be more supportive. - Have enough time to chat: If they do want to open up, a limited time slot can add pressure or make them feel cut off if you leave suddenly. - Avoid difficult times: For instance, meal times or food shopping if your friend has an eating disorder, or other particularly stressful points in their day.  ---"
