        "question": "Our Vision for Student Life",
        "answer": "Students as Collaborators\u00a0\u2013 We want to ensure we create as many opportunities for students to work alongside us as true co-producers and co-investors, knowledge builders and users. Redefining the Narrative - we have to achieve a span of reactionary support provision, alongside anticipatory presence and offer for the majority of our student body.\u00a0 We also have to consider strength-based models which do not lend as heavily on a deficit model. This will also consider a Mental Health and Wellness Continuum Cultural Competency, Compassion and Safety \u2013 We will ensure we better explore and ensure provision that is culturally competent - we have increased the diversity within our teams but want to go further. Our aims for compassion and safety will also look to embed this across the whole university, supporting the training and support needs of staff. With Safeguarding alignment sitting in this area also, this will ensure this is embedded and part of our business-as-usual approach, students need to feel that they belong but they also need to feel safe. Meeting and Supporting our Students and Stakeholders where they are. With the new city campus library refurbishment and the opening of our Student Life Space - we are bringing our services front and centre, in the hope to increase accessibility. With our increased capacity and capability, we hope to continue to build on our engagement and the uptake of our support by going to where students are. Embedded Interdisciplinary Evaluation Culture and Knowledge Mobilization\u00a0\u2013 We aim to build a research and innovation infrastructure, connecting people, ideas, and research. Work is already underway to work with each strand to develop their own theory of change model so that they can conceive KPI\u2019s and consider their vast data sources and the evaluation of them. We are designing and planning to launch a \u201cStudent Perception of Care Survey\u201d in 2025 and looking to embed into other data collection points such as Individual Learner Profile\u2019s and admissions. We also want to create student opportunity within this strand to consider driving authentic student engagement, which we also hope can be used to inform wider knowledge exchange within this remit in the wider sector given it is so scarce. Strength through Partnership\u00a0\u2013 As well as our own internal stakeholder partnerships, we must zoom out more and connect the multiple forms of commissioned services and offers that exist within our communities, where many of our students live and work. This will not only forge support provision but employability links which we have already achieved with our successful Student Wellbeing Champion Scheme. Continuous Improvement\u00a0\u2013 in essence, this strand, and the work we do, whilst it will have a clear theory of change so that we know what success looks like, is also the equivalent of \u201cpainting the fourth bridge\u201d we can never consider it a finished project and we will always be seeking continuous improvement.

        "question": "Concerned about your or a fellow students' ability to participate fully with academic life?",
        "answer": "The University is committed to\u00a0enabling inclusive student success.\u00a0\u00a0By reducing barriers to learning and support we hope to ensure all our students have the best experience while studying with us, and successfully progress to their chosen\u00a0career path or further study. Through Support to Study, we aim to ensure that no student gets left behind. The Support to Study policy provides a pathway for referral when concerns are raised about a student\u2019s academic progress, behaviour, health or wellbeing, or ability to live safely and independently whilst at university. This policy seeks to offer a holistic and supportive framework to ensure a proportionate, appropriate, and coordinated approach is enacted on every occasion that a cause for concern is raised. On this web page you will find an outline of the Support to Study Policy and processes, your responsibilities in the support to study process, and guidance on how and when to report a 'Cause for Concern'. The University defines Support to Study as the means by which we support and enable students, to participate, with reasonable adjustments where necessary, in the programmes of study and/or in university life in general, without negatively impacting the safety or wellbeing of themselves or others, and with full opportunities to meet the learning outcomes for their programme.   A cause for concern may be raised about a student due to any number of factors, they may include:   Cases are reviewed by a Cause for Concern Group. The Cause for Concern Group (CCG) meets weekly in person.\u00a0 It is coordinated by the Support to Study Coordinator and will include representatives from the following teams: If intervention is require then a cause for concern can be lodged by a student or staff member through the Cause for concern form. You can also report a concern or raise a query via email at: causeforconcern@wlv.ac.uk.  If you are not sure whether or not the case fits the\u00a0Support to Study\u00a0criteria, or if you want to know more about the policy and processes, come along to a Cause for Concern drop-in where you can talk to Support to Study Co-ordinator, either in person or digitally. https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/SupporttoStudy1@livewlvac.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/ This Support to Study policy has three Stages, with a fourth stage covering return to studies. The initial three stages are based on the degree of concern and the perceived seriousness of the situation, informed by an assessment of the case. A cause for concern can enter and be resolved at any stage and students may move between the stages depending on the nature of the concerns. At all stages, a student will be treated with dignity and respect, and will be strongly encouraged to engage in discussions and decisions as much as is reasonably practicable. During any meeting, students will be given the opportunity to discuss their experiences and support needs and agree a suitable plan to manage the situation effectively. Providing the student has grounds, as defined below, they may appeal against a decision made at stage two, three or four of the Support to Study Policy. The grounds for appeal are: Appeals must be submitted within 10 working days of receipt of the written decision and should be made in writing to: The Conduct and Appeals Unit Email: Conductandappeals@wlv.ac.uk  Appeals submitted more than 10 working days after receipt of the written decision may be considered where there is independent evidence to demonstrate that the student lacked the capacity to submit an appeal within the published deadline. Detailed guidance on these stages can be located in the procedure section of this policy."
